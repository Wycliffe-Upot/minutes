        <h3>MINUTE O3/O1/2023; PRELIMINARIES</h3>
        <p>After gaining the quorum, the chairman called the meeting to order and requested David Odhiambo to say an opening prayer. The chairman then highlighted the agenda of the meeting. There was no reading and confirmation of the previous minutes.
        </p>
        <h3>MINUTE O3/O2/2023; REGISTRATION OF THE GROUP</h3>
        <p>The chairman requested the secretary to brief the members about the progress of the registration of the group.</p>
        <p>The secretary said that no much progress had been made as far as requirements for registration were concerned. 
        <p>He observed that the treasurer should take members through these requirements one more time,therefore he welcomed the treasurer. </p>
        <p>The treasurer started by elaborating on the two registration processes required. He highlighted them as follows: </p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>(i) Registration by the Government through the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Development </em></strong> and </p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>(ii) Registration by the Biblia Sacco. </em></strong></p> 
        <p>He explained that before we register our group with the Biblia Sacco, we are required by the law to first formalize everything with the government. This, he noted, involves a couple of things which he broke down as follows: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                We first need to present the NAME under which we want the group registered for a name-search on eCitizen or at a nearby Huduma Centre at the cost of Ksh 150. This is to check whether the name has already been taken by another entity or not.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the name-search is successful, the chama name is reserved for 30 days during which we can register it.</li>
            <li>We need to be at least ten members and not more than forty.</li>
            <li>The chama must have officials, a postal address as well as a physical address.</li>
            <li>The primary officials must be members of the chama to avoid any conflict of interest among the associates. </li>
            <li>Furthermore, chama members must have an agreement to evade future misunderstandings, and each person must be allowed to voice out their opinions concerning the registration of the chama.</li>
            <li>The chama must have a constitution that guides its activities as well as membership directives including how to nominate officials.</li>
            <li>A fee of Ksh 1000 is needed to register the chama.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The treasurer further observed that,When all this is met, we can now head  to the Registrar of companies for registration. While there, we will be required to fill out a form with the following information:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Chama name</li>
            <li>Physical address of the chama</li>
            <li>Names and ID numbers of the members</li>
            <li>Email addresses and phone numbers of the members</li>
            <li>Proposed activities of the chama</li>
            <li>The contribution amount per member</li>
            <li>The duration of the chama</li>
            <li>Number of shares to be held by each shareholders</li>
            <li>Copy of ID/Passport of the shareholders</li>
            <li>Copy of iTax PIN certificate of the shareholders</li>
        </ol>
        <a href="Application Form for Registration of Self-Help Group.pdf">See the sample of the Application form for Registration</a>
        <p>When all this is done,we can now approach the Biblia Sacco with a request to open an account and save with them.</p>
        <p>The treasurer went ahead to point out the requirements by the Biblia Sacco for registration as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Constitution</li>
            <li>Mission/Faith Statement</li>
            <li>Certificate of Registration </li>
            <li>6 months Bank Statement/Audited Accounts</li>
            <li>Application Letter</li>
            <li>2 copies of minutes of the previous meetings</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>It was at this point that the members agreed to hold another meeting on 20th October 2023 to deliberate and ruminate on all this issues. </p>
        <p>The treasurer reported that, based on how quickly we move, the earliest time we can formalize all this things and have our group registered is April 2024.</p>
        <p>He further promised to share some sample constitutions from other groups to help members come up with suitable clauses for our constitution.
        <p>He pointed out critical areas that need deeper thinking and sober deliberations by members when we'll be writing our constitution.He noted them as thus: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Next of kin,</li>
            <li>Agree on the amount to channel to the Biblia Sacco,</li>
            <li>How to solve issues of failure to pay loan in the event we take one, </li>
            <li>The refund procedure in case a member dies or withdraws.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>MINUTE O3/O3/2023; AOB</h3>
        <p>Amos Tindi reinforced on the need by members to update their monthly contributions saying that it is appalling to see many defaulters. He regretted being among the defaulters but was quick to add that he has plans to recoup the months he has defaulted. </p>
        <p>Elly encouraged members to think of possible investment opportunities that we can undertake as a group .</p>
        <p>Maxwell Miaka asked members to fully embrace the group noting that it is a vehicle to economic empowerment. He further promised to update his contributions soon.</p>
        <p>The treasurer put forward the request to allow two more members to join the group saying that they had shown their interest in the group and had promised to update their savings to match the other members.</p>
        <p>Elly welcomed the idea of allowing the two new members so that we cap the number at 15, he however cautioned against having a bloated membership citing the challenges that usually emerge with such big numbers. After deliberating on the issue, most members came to an agreement eventually that Benson Otiende and Evanson Mwaura be allowed to join the group.</p>
            <h3>MINUTE 03/04/;ADJOURNMENT</h3>
            <p>There being no any other business to discuss, the meeting adjourned at 1930 hours after a closing prayer said by Elly Ochieng.</p>
